# AWS SAA-CO2 Notes - 2020

# AWS Fundamentals: IAM & EC2

## AWS Regions 

  - AWS has Regions all around the world 
  - Names can be: us-east-1, eu-west-3… 
  - A region is a cluster of data centers 
  - Most AWS services are region-scoped

## AWS Availability Zones

  - Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 2, max is 6). 
  - Example:
  - ap-southeast-2a
  - ap-southeast-2b
  - ap-southeast-2c
  - Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
  - They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters
  - They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking
